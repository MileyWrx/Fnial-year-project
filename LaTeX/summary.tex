Bayesian optimization is commoly used in machine learning fields. In each iteration, it selects one more sample to evaluate, and update the probability model. However, with the developmet of modern technology, parallel computing is available and this traditional way is not suitable for usage. It is more efficient to select a batch of points and evaluate them at the same time.
\par Therefore, in this project, the author will compare different batched Bayesian optimization algorithms to study their advantages and drawbacks, as well as ideas for extending the traditional Bayesian optimization to parallel computing.
