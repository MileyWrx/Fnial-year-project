\justifying
I am extremely grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Dawei Zhan for his guidance and assistance at every stage of this project. Honestly speaking, completion of this report would have not been possible without him.
\par I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Dr. Mark Walkley for his detailed feedback on the intermediate report, provided me with useful comments and suggestions.

\par Moreover, thanks to those generous people who kindly shared their teaching material and course recording online (see appendix B), enabling me to learn the mathematical principles behind this research topic by myself.

\par Finally, a special 'thank you' to my family for their continued support and encouragement in the past 21 years.\par
