\chapter{Project Management and Planning}
\label{chapter1}

\section{Report structure}
In this report, the following sections will be covered: Project management and planning will take up the first section, mainly covering the project aim and objectives, things to be submitted, and the initial schedule. Then, the author will introduce basic knowledge needed for the topic, including gaussian process model, bayesian optimization and batched bayesian optimization. In chapter 3, three popular algorithms and conducted experiments will be explained in detail, where the author will compare and learn from the result. Finally, the author will make self apprasial, reflecting on time management, obstacles and how she handled them, as well as things learned.
% \hspace{1em} Explain briefly what each section will cover.\\
\section{Aim}
\justifying
This project aims to carry out a comprehensive analysis, both theoretical and empirical, of different algorithms used for batched Bayesian optimization. In this project, the author learned principles from gaussian process model to traditional Bayesian optimization, and investigated ways to implement batched Bayesian optimization based on literature review. To test the performance of different algorithms, experiments  was carried out on a variaty of functions with different batch size. Different algorithms were compared, by analyzing the outcome of experiments, and comparing the advanteges and drawbacks.
\par Hopefully, after reading this report, the reader can have a general understanding of algorithms that are widely used nowadays, as well as the principles they base on.
\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\bullet$]Have a deep understanding of Gaussian process, Bayesian optimization, batched Bayesian optimization, and understand the principles behind usages.
	\item[$\bullet$]Conduct background research into different algorithms of batched Bayesian optimization, learning from the pre-existing work.
	\item[$\bullet$]Implement three popular algorithms - Kriging Believer, Constant Liar, and Multi-Modal Expected Improvement
	\item[$\bullet$]Conduct experiments on different functions, and compare the performances on finding minimum value of these functions.
	\item[$\bullet$]Make comparison and contrast of the results from different algorithms, and analyze the advantage and drawback.
\end{itemize}
\section{Deliverables}
\hspace{1em} At the end of the project, the following things will be delivered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\bullet$]Source code to implement different algorithms
	\item[$\bullet$]Datasets generated for testing each algorithm
	\item[$\bullet$]Plots indicating the outcome of each experiment
	\item[$\bullet$]The final report
\end{itemize}
\section{Schedule}
Schedule of the project can be divided into three consecutive phrases: knowledge accumulation, coding, and analyzing.
\par In the first two months, the author will supplement mathematical knowledge, and read papers about the topic. Then the implementation of three popular algorithms will take three months, including not only coding but also detailed testing on different functions with different parameters. Phrase 3 will be conducted in the mean time: The author will analyze the result of each experiment and make conparisons. And writing the academic report will take two months, from late March to early May.
