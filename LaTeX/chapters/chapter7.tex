\section{Timeline}
As the mathematical formula is a bit hard for me, the time used for background research significantly increased:

\section{Obstacles}
The biggest obstacle lies on Mathematics:both trying to understand the mathematical formula behind background knowledge and the mathematical deriviation of equations in the paper. To tackle this problem, I managed to find resources on youtube, and read some of the blogs (see appendix B). Again, thanks to those people who generously shared these material online!!!
\par the next obstacle is to use LATEX. I have to admit that I'm not very good at it. The last day before deadline, my LATEX file could not compile, and all the pictures were in a mass. I used two days to fix this issue. Which lead to the late submit. Some pictures are a bit obscure, as i used Microsoft word to align them, and took a screenshot, then put them into LATEX. Sorry for the inconvenience.
